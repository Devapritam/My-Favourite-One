        <p id="my_fav_hob_wrtup_p1">Reading is important because it develops our thoughts, gives us endless knowledge and lessons while keeping our minds active. The importance of a book to help us learn and understand things. I have made a habit of reading books as I realized that it is very important to develop our skills and improve our knowledge vocabulary. It also aids in sleep readiness, reduces stress, lowers blood pressure and heart rate, fights depression symptoms, prevents cognitive decline as you age, and many other positive effects on our body. Everyone should make a habit of reading books as it is very important in our life and very good for our brain and our body.</p>

        <div class="parallax-inner"></div>
        <p id="my_fav_hob_wrtup_p2">As we know, 21st Century is the century of information and technology. To suceed in this new information based and highly technological society, we need to develop our capabilities beyond the classroom activities. Programming helps in developing that capabilities among us. As over few years our life is fully going to be automatic, it is very important to learn this language of tomorrow. When we expose ourselves to this new world, it gives us an experience of as we are in the world of technology and robotics. It also gives us an understanding of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and about Robotics. Programming helps children learn to problem-solving. Understanding computers and learning the basics of coding helps children to develop an appreciation of how things work. It also teaches them how software engineers use math in order to solve problems in a logical and creative way. As I understood all this importance of coding, I exposed myself to this new world. One of the other thoughts that led me to learn coding is I whenever saw a game I always thought of how it was made. I brought a new thought and interest in my mind and therefore led me to learn coding. At last, I would advise everyone that all should learn this language of tomorrow to succed in this information based and highly technological age.</p>
