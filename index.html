        <div class="parallax-inner"></div>
        <p id="my_fav_hob_wrtup_p1">Reading is important because it develops our thoughts, gives us endless knowledge and lessons while keeping our minds active. The importance of a book to help us learn and understand things. I have made a habit of reading books as I realized that it is very important to develop our skills and improve our knowledge vocabulary. It also aids in sleep readiness, reduces stress, lowers blood pressure and heart rate, fights depression symptoms, prevents cognitive decline as you age, and many other positive effects on our body. Everyone should make a habit of reading books as it is very important in our life and very good for our brain and our body.</p>

        <div class="parallax-inner"></div>
        <p id="my_fav_hob_wrtup_p2">As we know, 21st Century is the century of information and technology. To suceed in this new information based and highly technological society, we need to develop our capabilities beyond the classroom activities. Programming helps in developing that capabilities among us. As over few years our life is fully going to be automatic, it is very important to learn this language of tomorrow. When we expose ourselves to this new world, it gives us an experience of as we are in the world of technology and robotics. It also gives us an understanding of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and about Robotics. Programming helps children learn to problem-solving. Understanding computers and learning the basics of coding helps children to develop an appreciation of how things work. It also teaches them how software engineers use math in order to solve problems in a logical and creative way. As I understood all this importance of coding, I exposed myself to this new world. One of the other thoughts that led me to learn coding is I whenever saw a game I always thought of how it was made. I brought a new thought and interest in my mind and therefore led me to learn coding. At last, I would advise everyone that all should learn this language of tomorrow to succed in this information based and highly technological age.</p>

        <br>
        <p id="inspiration">My inspiration is Sir Srinavasa Iyengar Ramanujan (22 December 1887 - 26 April 1920). Sir S.Ramanujan was a great Mathematician of the Mordern India and played a very important role in the 20th Century Mathematics. He worked very hard to find the great formulae for solving complex mathematical problems and equations. I was very inspired by his work when I read his biography. Sir Ramanujan found many great formulae that made many complex equations easy to solve. Some of them are: Landau-Ramanujan Constant, Ramanujan Prime, Mock Theta Functions, Ramanujan Conjecture, Ramanujan's Sum, Ramanujan-Soldner Constant, Ramanujan Theta Functions, Ramanujan's Master Theorems, and many other complex formulaes. I got a lot of motivation to learn mathematics and science as it very essential for our daily life. I also started reading books about many prominent scientists of India and their biography and their contributions to the world of mathematics and science. And I learnt a lot of things when I rean them. And it also led to take reading books as a hobby. I am trying hard to be like Sir S.Ramanujan and I hope that I can also help the world in the field of mathematics and science.</p>
